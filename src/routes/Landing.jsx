          <h2>ðŸš€ How MentorMe Works</h2>
          <p>
            MentorMe simplifies the complex â€” matching students with mentors who truly align. Here's how:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Take the Quiz</strong><br />
              Students and mentors each complete a lightning-fast onboarding quiz that captures their passions, goals, and shared experiences â€” from sports and clubs to career interests and alma maters.
            </li>
            <li><strong>AI-Powered Matching</strong><br />
              Our proprietary AI engine finds meaningful connections, not just overlaps. We match based on shared values, not just keywords â€” because mentorship should feel natural, not forced.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Smart Onboarding & Crash Courses</strong><br />
              Students get instant access to pro tips and a crash course on how to build a lasting mentorship â€” so every connection starts with confidence.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Chat. Connect. Grow.</strong><br />
              From guided chats to career insights, students can engage with mentors, track progress, and unlock a future shaped by experience â€” all in a secure, school-backed platform.
            </li>
          </ul>

        {/* ABOUT US */}
        <section className="about" id="about">
          <h2>ðŸ’¡ About Us</h2>
          <p>
            MentorMe began with a simple question: What if every student had someone to show them the way?
          </p>
          <p>
            Weâ€™re not a Silicon Valley behemoth â€” weâ€™re two high school students, Russell Fitzgerald and Jett Honig, who saw firsthand how mentorship could transform lives but noticed how broken, outdated, and impersonal most systems were. So we built something better.
          </p>
          <p>
            MentorMe is the next-generation mentorship platform that bridges students with real-world guidance â€” powered by AI, backed by schools, and built with heart. Our mission is to democratize access to wisdom, connection, and opportunity by creating a space where students and mentors actually want to engage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you're a student figuring out your path, a mentor hoping to give back, or a school looking to empower your community â€” MentorMe delivers an experience thatâ€™s intuitive, secure, and built for meaningful growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe mentorship isnâ€™t a feature â€” itâ€™s a foundation. And weâ€™re here to rebuild it from the ground up.
          </p>
